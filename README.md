# Build Your Own Form using Google Apps Script

This script allows users to submit their name through a custom form built with Google Apps Script. The form submission is processed by a server-side script that checks against a list of allowed inputs.

## Key Features

- Custom form built with Google Apps Script: The form is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be customized to fit your needs.
- Server-side form processing: The form submission is processed by a server-side script that checks if the submitted name is valid and has not already been submitted.
- Integration with Google Sheets: The script uses the SpreadsheetApp service to access and manipulate data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
- Custom error handling: If the submitted name is not in the registered list or has already been submitted, the script displays a custom error message to the user.

## How is this different from Google Forms?

Google Forms is a tool that allows you to create and share surveys, quizzes, and forms. It provides an easy-to-use interface for building forms and collecting responses, but it has some limitations when it comes to customizing the form and processing the responses.

This script provides more flexibility in terms of form customization and response processing. You can build a custom form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and use server-side scripts to process the form submission and manipulate data in a Google Sheets spreadsheet. This allows you to implement custom logic and validation rules that may not be possible with Google Forms.

## Use as a Template for Building Custom Forms

This script can serve as a template for building custom forms with advanced validation. You can use it as a starting point for creating your own forms, and expand upon it by adding more fields, implementing more complex validation rules, or integrating with other Google services.

By using this script as a template, you can quickly get started with building custom forms without having to start from scratch. You can leverage the existing code for building the form, processing the submission, and integrating with Google Sheets, and focus on adding your own custom logic and validation rules. Basic styling is already applied to the form, so you can get started faster and have a visually appealing form right away.
